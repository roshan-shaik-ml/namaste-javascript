### Lesson Main Points

> Everything in JavaScript happens inside an **Execution Context**

> JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language.

### Short Notes

Execution Context = Memory (variable environment ) + Code (Thread of Execution)

Single-threaded -> JavaScript can execute only one command at a time.

Synchronous -> In a specific order, goes to nextline only when the current line is finished.

### Takeaway
